    <h3>Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, the “==” operator compares the value of the variables while the “===” operator compares both the type and value of the variables</p><hr>
    <h3>What are the differences between var, let and const?</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, “var” is used to declare variables that are globally scoped or function scoped. “let” and “const” are block-scoped.
        <br>
        Variables declared with “var” can be updated and re-declared within its scope. Variables declared with “let” can be updated but not re-declared. <br>
        Variables declared with “const” cannot be updated or re-declared.
    </p><hr>
    <h3>What is hoisting?</h3>
    <p>Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).<br>
        In other words, a variable can be used before it has been declared1. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.<br>
        For example, if you declare a variable using “var” after it has been used, the declaration will be hoisted to the top of the function or global scope.
    </p><hr>
    <h3>What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
    <p>The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior that occurs with variables declared using “let” and “const” keywords.
        <br>In JavaScript, variables declared with “let” and “const” are hoisted to the top of their block scope but are not initialized. This means that if you try to access the variable before it has been initialized, you will get a ReferenceError.
        <br>The TDZ is the period between the start of the block scope and the initialization of the variable.
    </p><hr>
    <h3>What is meant by first class functions</h3>
    <p>First class functions are a programming language feature that allows functions to be treated like any other value. This means you can assign functions to variables, pass functions as arguments to other functions, return functions as values from other functions, and store functions in data structures.</p><hr>
    <h3>What are pure functions?</h3>
    <p>Pure functions in JavaScript are functions that always return the same result for the same input and have no side effects such as modifying arguments, global variables, or outputting something.</p><hr>
